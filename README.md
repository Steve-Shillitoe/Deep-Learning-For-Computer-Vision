Deep Learning with Keras

This project contains Python modules written in order to learn Deep Learning using Keras. 

In the first module **1_Data_Classification.py**, Keras is used to created a machine learning module that can detect whether a banknote is a forgery or not.  The training data is numerical values in a CSV file.
