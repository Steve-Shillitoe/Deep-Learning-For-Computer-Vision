# Deep-Learning-For-Computer-Vision
Deep Learning with Keras

This project contains Python modules written in order to learn Deep Learning using Keras. 

In the first module **1_Data_Classification.py**, Keras is used to create a machine learning module that can detect whether a banknote is a forgery or not.  The training data is numerical values in a CSV file.

In the second module **2_Keras_CNN_With_MNIST.py**, Keras is used to create a Convolutional Neural Network **CNN** to classify images of handwritten digits 0-9 in the MNIST dataset.
